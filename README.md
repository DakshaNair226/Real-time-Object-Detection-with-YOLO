# Real-time-Object-Detection-with-YOLO
There are certain limitations in commonly used object detection approaches, due  to which, it is often necessary to sacrifice accuracy in order to ensure the infer  speed of the detector that is in practice. Therefore, it is important to achieve the  balance between effectiveness and efficiency of object detector. The goal of this  project is to implement an object detector with relatively balanced effectiveness  as well as efficiency that can be directly applied in practical scenarios, rather  than propose a novel detection model. aim to develop a real-time object detection model based on YOLO-V3  network to solve the underlying problems with existing methods and incorporate fast and improved detection.
